Why doesn't this file have anything in it?

FULL DISCLOSURE - the master branch version of bleak includes a Google Analytics
tracking tag. This tracking tag helps me, the developer of bleak, measure
its reach and usage, assess the uptake of new features and the kinds of device
it's being used on.

YOU HAVE OPTED OUT OF THIS TRACKING. That's totally fine. Thanks for reading ‚ù§
